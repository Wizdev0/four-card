```css
.one{
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 100;
}
.two{
    font-size: 2.4rem;
    font-family: "poppins",sans-serif;
    font-weight: 600;
}
.three{
    margin-top: 15px;
    font-family: "poppins", sans-serif;
    font-size: 1rem;
    width:540px;
}
.three-sub{
    font-family: "poppins", sans-serif;
    font-size: 1rem;
    width: 400px;
}
```


### Continued development
In the future am still going to learn more about transitions, Positioning, animations, flexbox and grid.
